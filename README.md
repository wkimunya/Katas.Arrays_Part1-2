# Katas.Arrays_Part1-2
## Individual Katas Part 1

Given an array of integers, arr, find out 2 indices m, n(0<=m<=arr.length-1, 0<=n<=arr.length-1, m<=n), so that as long as all elements in the subarray(from index m to n, indices m and n inclusive) are sorted properly, with this sorted subarray relacing original subarray, the whole array is sorted (no matter ascendingly or descendingly).
The subarray should include the least number of elements, means (n-m) must be of the smallest value, and n should also be the smallest one.
The function accepts an array of integers, arr, return the subarray's start and end index in array format, [m,n] as a result.
For example, in an array [1,2,3,6,4,4], the SMALLEST(with the least numbers of integers) subarray to be found is [6,4,4], if we sort it to [4,4,6], then replace the original subarray, the whole array now turns to be[1,2,3,4,4,6], which is sorted completely. This subarray begins from index 3, and ends in index 5, so the result is [3,5].
If all elements in the array are the same, return array [0,0]. If all elements in the array are already sorted, no matter ascendingly or descendingly, return [0,0] as well

## Individual Katas part 2 

Write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a sorted array containing the same strings, ordered from shortest to longest.
For example, if this array were passed as an argument:
["Telescopes", "Glasses", "Eyes", "Monocles"]
Your function would return the following array:
["Eyes", "Glasses", "Monocles", "Telescopes"]
All of the strings in the array passed to your function will be different lengths, so you will not have to decide how to order multiple strings of the same length.
